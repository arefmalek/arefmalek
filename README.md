### Hi! I'm Aref 🌱

I'm currently a university student and love to make things on the side. You can find some more about me on this profile or [my website](https://arefmalek.me/).


I'm always trying to explore new areas of CS, but currently I am interested in AI and Algorithms. In school, however, I'm currently registered for Virtual Reality and Operating Systems, so I'm all over the place.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Blog series, and scaling a passion project of mine.
- 📖 I’m currently learning more Javascript in my free time to finally port my Python projects to web 


* 💻 Here are some things in tech I'm planning on learning soon
  + Graphics (Ray Tracer has been in the works for a while now, now I'm all in with this VR course)
  + Functional Programming
* 🌱 Outside of Tech, here are other things I'm working towards:
  + Staying active and lifting more 💪
  + Learning Arabic 
  + Finally finishing 1984 👁


- 💬 Ask me about: Anything! I mainly work on AI/ML right now, but a student must always stay curious :^)
