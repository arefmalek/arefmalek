### Hi! I'm Aref ðŸŒ±

I'm currently a university student and love to make things on the side. You can find some more about me on this profile or [my website](https://arefmalek.me/).



Right now I'm working a lot with Vision and general ML, but I'm trying to keep an open mind towards all aspects of tech that excite me. 

* ðŸ’» some Tech stuff I want to learn:
  + GANs
  + Graphics Programming (Ray Tracer has been in the works for a while now)
  + Functional Programming
  + Building an electric skateboard
  + Video editing 
* ðŸš€ Some non-tech goals right now are:
  + Becoming a better cook
  + Getting better at my second language
  + Working out more

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything! I mainly work on AI/ML right now, but a student must always stay curious :^)
