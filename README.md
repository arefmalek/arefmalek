### Hi! I'm Aref ðŸŒ±

I'm currently a university student and love to make things on the side. You can find some more about me on this profile or [my website](https://arefmalek.github.io/).

In my final semester of CS, I'm hoping to learn a bunch more about fundamental CS topics, specifically Compilers and Networking! In the past, I really enjoyed coursework with ML, Algorithms, and OS, but I'm trying to get more out of my comfort zone :).

Professionally I've been all over the place, recently I've recently just completed an internship at Tesla where I worked a a full-stack dev on the Energy Product Software Team. 

#### Previously I've been
- ðŸ”¥ An intern at NASA Langley working on localization algorithms for wildfires (using multi-spectral imaging!). Was very cool experience for research exposure
- ðŸ“½ Worked on the AWS Panorama team where we launched a sideloading application for the Panorama devices
- ðŸ’¾ TA for computer architecture at Purdue!

#### There are some things I want to do in the near future

- ðŸ©º Get active again! I'm looking to lift again and hopefully return to swimming in my final semester. We'll see if I'm active and in shape again (hope so!)
- âš’ Tinkering more. My best times were definitely when I had time to explore interests with small passion projects. I would really like to get into that in my final semester
- ðŸ“š Read a book or two. Be it self help or other interest, I want to move my habits of consuming content online to books, I think it'll be sustainable to avoid the allusion of choice with internet information (especially on sensitive topics).

All in all, I'm someone that really wants to reap the benefits of getting out of ones comfort zone, but that's easier said than done! I trying to do it one day at a time :)

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Anything! My interests are changing a lot recently, but that also means I'm open to talk about what I've learned and more importantly hear more :^)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Linkedin is pretty good, an inmail will pretty much always work
